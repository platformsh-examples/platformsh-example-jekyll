# Deploying GatsbyJS on Platformsh

*date: 2019-02-17T18:39:10+01:00*

## 1. Setup your local machine

You'll need 3 tools to deploy your Hugo site on Platform.sh:

- node 8+: [install git](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- npx: `sudo npm install -g npx`
- Optional: [the platform.sh cli tool](https://docs.platform.sh/gettingstarted/cli.html)

For each of these tools please refer to their own install page.

On macOS, this is basically 4 commands:

```sh
brew install node@8
sudo npm install -g npx
brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php
brew install curl git php72-cli php72-curl
curl -sS https://platform.sh/cli/installer | php
```

## 2. Bootstrap your GatsbyJS project

We need to create a new GatsbyJS folder from a template:

```sh
$ npx gatsby new gatsby-hello https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog       
npx: installed 1384 in 33.248s

You can now run the development server:

```sh
$ cd gatsby-hello && npm run develop

> gatsby-starter-blog@0.1.0 develop /media/psh/customers/gatsby-hello

You can now view gatsby-starter-blog in the browser.

  http://localhost:8000/

View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema

  http://localhost:8000/___graphql

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build

ℹ ｢wdm｣: 
ℹ ｢wdm｣: Compiled successfully.
```

Browse [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to check that everything is working as expected.

The `npx` template already creates a basic git repository:

```
$ git log
commit cd34e2366e6c28de7e0db53b527d6d4ddb1b7952 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Guillaume Moigneu <guillaume.moigneu@platform.sh>
Date:   Mon Feb 18 12:33:26 2019 +0100

    Initial commit from gatsby: (https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog.git)
```

## 3. Create your platformsh project

Create a Platform.sh project by signing to [a trial account](https://accounts.platform.sh/platform/trial/general/setup) or log in to your account.

Select a `Standard` project and then choose the region you want your project to be hosted in.

Review and validate. You can now access your newly provisioned project. On the wizard, click `Git remote` and copy it.

Add the remote to your local project:

```sh
git remote add platform <project ID>@git.<region>.platform.sh:<project ID>.git
```

**Don't push anything for now**

## 4. Setup the .platform.app.yaml configuration

Platform.sh relies on `yaml` configurations to configure the different containers to deploy. 
Create the `.platform.app.yaml` file at the root of your project and add the following code:

```yaml
# .platform.app.yaml

# The name of this application, which must be unique within a project.
name: 'gatsbyjs'

# The type key specifies the language and version for your application.
type: 'nodejs:8.9'

# The hooks that will be triggered when the package is deployed.
hooks:
    # Build hooks can modify the application files on disk but not access any services like databases.
    build: |
      npm run build

# The size of the persistent disk of the application (in MB).
disk: 5120

# The configuration of the application when it is exposed to the web.
web:
    locations:
        '/':
            # The public directory of the application relative to its root.
            root: 'public'
            index: ['index.html']
            scripts: false
            allow: true
```

We need also two other files: `routes.yaml` and `services.yaml`. `services.yaml` is used to configure additional services like databases so we don't need it for that project. Just create the file:

```sh
mkdir .platform
touch services.yaml
```

Add `routes.yaml` in the `.platform` folder and add the following configuration:

```yaml
"https://{default}/":
  type: upstream
  upstream: "gatsbyjs:http"
```

This file tells the platform router to direct all incoming requests to our `gatsbyjs` container. Commit these new files:

```sh
git add .platform.app.yaml .platform
git commit -m "Add platform.sh configuration"
```

## 5. Test and deploy

We are now ready to deploy the project on Platform.sh. Push the repository to the new remote:

```sh
git push platform master
```

Let's review the ouput of your `push`. The first part is basic git. Files and commits are getting pushed to the remote:

```sh
Counting objects: 44, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (38/38), done.
Writing objects: 100% (44/44), 1.04 MiB | 16.98 MiB/s, done.
Total 44 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
```

Platform.sh then analyze your repository, pull submodules and validate your configuration syntax:

```sh
Validating submodules

Validating configuration files
```

The most important part is now to build your container image (the `build` hook). It will execute the `npm run build` we defined. As there is a `package.json` file in the folder, Platform.sh also launch an `install`

```sh
Building application 'gatsbyjs' (runtime type: nodejs:8.9, tree: fafb3d4)
      Generating runtime configuration.

```

Platform.sh then checks that everything seems correct and deploys the container to a host. You'll see that Platform.sh also generates the Let's Encrypt TLS certificate for your project. 

```sh
      Executing pre-flight checks...

      Beaming package to its final destination.

    W: Route '{default}' doesn't map to a domain of the project, mangling the route.

        https://master-7rqtwti-<project ID>.<region>.platformsh.site/ is served by application `gatsbyjs`
```

The last output is the new URL of your application. You can also check that the project has been successully deployed on the web interface:

Now go the URL and you will be able to see your GatsbyJS site
